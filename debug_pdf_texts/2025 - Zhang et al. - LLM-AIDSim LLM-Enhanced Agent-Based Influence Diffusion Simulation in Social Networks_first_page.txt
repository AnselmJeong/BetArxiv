Abstract: This paper introduces an LLM-Enhanced Agent-Based Influence Diffusion Sim-
ulation (LLM-AIDSim) framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into
agent-based modelling to simulate influence diffusion in social networks. The proposed
framework enhances traditional influence diffusion models by allowing agents to gen-
erate language-level responses, providing deeper insights into user agent interactions.
Our framework addresses the limitations of probabilistic models by simulating realistic,
context-aware user behaviours in response to public statements. Using real-world news
topics, we demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-AIDSim in simulating topic evolution
and tracking user discourse, validating its ability to replicate key aspects of real-world
information propagation. Our experimental results highlight the role of influence diffusion
in shaping collective discussions, revealing that, over time, diffusion narrows the focus
of conversations around a few dominant topics. We further analyse regional differences
in topic clustering and diffusion behaviours across three cities, Sydney, Auckland, and
Hobart, revealing how demographics, income, and education levels influence topic dom-
inance. This work underscores the potential of LLM-AIDSim as a decision-support tool
for strategic communication, enabling organizations to anticipate and understand public
sentiment trends.

1. Introduction
Information propagation describes how information, ideas, or opinions are spread
through social networks [ 1–3]. In the context of public communication, refers to the
diffusion of statements released by organisations, such as news, policies, or public an-
nouncements, through social networks [4]. This process is particularly applicable to many
business companies and government organisations, as it impacts public perception and
influences individuals’ decision-making behaviours. Effective information propagation can
enhance organisational outreach and drive significant societal impacts, while poorly crafted
statements can exacerbate public concerns and even lead to crises [5]. However, a critical
issue when disseminating an official statement is that the public response is somewhat
unpredictable [4]. This loss of control may even lead to polarisation and extremism in social
networks [1,6].
Simulating potential outcomes prior to public release can help address this challenge
by summarising potential public concerns for decision-makers to consider, allowing them
